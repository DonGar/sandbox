The 'g' command will take to you any development sandbox directory
inside 'SANDBOX_ROOT' (with tab completion). It will set 'SANDBOX' to
the name of the sandbox (directory name), and SANDBOX_DIR to the root
of the sandbox.

When entering a sandbox ".devenv" is sourced. This allows you to set
additional variables as needed (GOPATH, etc), enter a virtualenv, or
whatever else is needed for the project in question.

The alias 'src' will take you to the root of the current sandbox. The
alias 'code' will take you to directory present in the .code file in
the root of the sandbox. The idea is that src takes you to the root,
and code takes you to the part of the code you are working in most
actively.

The sublime wrapper will auto-create / use a new project file for each
sandbox.

To use the sandbox aware sublime wrapper, invoke:
  "${SANDBOX_ROOT}/sandbox/sublime/sublime" directory, via alias, or
  via path.

This will use a sublime project/workspace file for the current sandbox
(and created it, if needed), and store it in a location other than the
sandbox.
